Then I just realized that everyone has the same problem and they write their stories but then hesitated for a long time, to finally delete them. But I've found that the more I tell, the more I can overcome those problems and have someone else to stand with instead of being afraid of getting hurt. So if someone out there has a story of themselves, I always want to say, \"Tell your story, I listen to.\"",
